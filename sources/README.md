# Introduction

As the timeline of Tyler is vast there have been various sets of instructions that have formed over time. Some contain minor changes, and others contain major changes. However most instructions are based on **Project 89**, **Telecomix**, and **Project Mayhem 2012** which would spawn **#TheGame23**.

The instructions are laid out in chronological order for you, so that you can also trace back the development of Tyler to the first public appearance in 2008/09 under various different names like **Cameron** and **Michael**.
