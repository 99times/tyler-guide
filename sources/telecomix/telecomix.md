### HOW TO BUILD A CLUSTER LIKE TELECOMIX

We want to be copied because we believe that there is no
limit to how many activist clusters there can be in the
world. Below are some instructions on how we did it. Of
course, there is a multitude of other ways to do it. We
want to share our experiences.


#### Throw a party with friends
Throw a party with friends who share similar interests.
Cook some food if you like, or buy some beer, it is up to
 what you prefer. Make sure you have internet connectivity
and encourage people to bring laptops. Play music. Or, if
you do not have a place to entertain, find a pub or internet
cafe that you can meet in and bring your laptops too.

#### Start and IRC/Discord/Telegram
Start an IRC/Discord/Telegam and spread all over the internet
that this is the place where stuff happens.

#### Gather friends with various skills
Gather friends with various skills. You will need coders
as well as philosophers, people who know politics and people
who know Photoshop (or GIMP, because it's free :p ). Make
sure your friends know also how to have **#FUN**, since otherwise
you won't get anything done. Activism is not rocket science,
so just spread out skills. Think multiplicity rather than
expertise!

#### Register sites with cool names
Register sites with cool names, like Werebuild.eu and
Telecomix.org. Make sure people can find you easily. Write
with slogans.

#### Become friends with important people
Become friends with important people. Contact politicians,
bureaucrats, presidents, corporations, other activists,
hackers, artists, etc. Do not have principles for selecting
beforehand whom you speak to. Flirt a lot, but never do
anything you would regret. Build trust, and make sure you
work together. Politicians will need your votes, corporations
will need your consumption. Understand that you are important,
but do not become too self-important. Do things like watch
movies together to keep your feet on the ground.


#### Install Mediawiki, Wordpress and use Evernote
Install Mediawiki, Wordpress and use Evernote. Also,
fill your IRC/Discord/Telegram with bots. Share all data. Do not
respect copyright! Do copy all floppies.

#### Throw more parties
Throw more parties. Invent vocabularies. Speak like lolcats.
Make music together, even if it sounds strange.

#### If you run into Internet trolls
If you run into Internet trolls, troll back or make sure
you kick them off your side of the internets. Or, be cooler
than them, and make them join you (see, Troll them back) Do not
let them make you sad.

#### Start new political campaigns often
Start new political campaigns often. Call them raids,
operations, projects or any word of choice. Write instructions
and tutorials. Make sure a total newbie can understand what
you are going to do. Synchronize your work. Countdown just
like a space shuttle takeoff.

#### Get together a list of clear and simple talking points
Get together a list of clear and simple talking points,
in the event that you have to "present" on the fly. Make
sure that you have a few easy-to remember facts to back up
your statements. Make t-shirts to spur conversations with
random people on the streets. Rent an airplane with a banner
behind it to get an entire city asking "who/what was that."
Then station people on street corners to explain. Send
people to the moon and spraypaint your URL on the surface. <3

#### Install an artificial intelligence bot
Install an artificial intelligence bot. Ours is called Cameron. Ask her lots of things. Quote Cameron
in your conversations.

#### Translate stuff to other languages
Translate stuff to other languages. Remember that the
Internet does not care about nation states. You never know
who will join you if you go internetional. Stamp your internet
visa in your passport.

#### Statements are not only for stating things
Statements are not only for stating things. Statements
also makes things harder to forget. By sending out messages
of events, activities and other tips you make them unforgettable
and eternal. For instance, by making public reminders to people
with power, you can change their agenda.

#### Even if you are fighting against horrible laws
Even if you are fighting against horrible laws, even if
your mission seems impossible to accomplish â€“ do not be sad!
Lulz are as important as change. Your goal can be serious
even if you do it for the lulz. Remember to smile when you
are in the middle of a stormy campaign.

#### Just, never be sad in general
Just, never be sad in general, it's not very lolcat-like.

#### Create a GIANT twitter network
Create a GIANT twitter network. Whenever you tweet something,
have people retweet it, and ask their friends to retweet it as
well....tweets multiply like bunnies. Always strive for "deep
tweets", i.e. make people retweet your message all over the world.
Get in the habit of making your tweets very descriptive but concise,
so people do not have to click a link to know if they are
interested or not, they will be able to tell by what your tweet says.

#### Don't be obsessed with doing things "right"
Don't be obsessed with doing things "right". Instead of
thinking too much, tinker instead. Proceed by way of experimentation,
try things out. If they fail, make sure to laugh a little,
then try a different way. Collect experiences in your wiki,
learn from the mistakes. Share all knowledge freely with others.

#### Totally go for it fearlessly
Totally go for it fearlessly, while boldly sparking and
nurturing collective bursts of supercharged play, inspired
creative inventions and spontaneous depths of strategic fun.
Do not be afraid to appear temporarily foolish. (!) Inspire
the body-politic to incarnate creatively via totemized
teleportation-flows of datalove.

#### Make logos and have them look cool
Make logos and have them look cool. Remix the logos of
old government agencies. Use fractal patterns. In general,
be a cyber hippie. Create symbols to dive in the channels.
Be esoteric about botnet raids. If the channel splits, stay
in the other side for a little while.

#### Organize without a clear leadership or membership status
Organize without a clear leadership or membership status.
Have anyone joining your discussions be a part of your cluster.
If they don't agree, they will leave soon anyway. Organize like
a gang or a pack. Don't use pyramidal structures or formalized
positions. Be nomadic in thought and associate yourself with
many others.

#### If it is within your means, travel a lot
If it is within your means, travel a lot. Talk to people
where ever you go, and tell them about what you are doing.
Tell them to join you if they like the idea, thus creating a
network within your country/region of the world, perhaps even
internetionally.

#### Be open with everything you do
Be open with everything you do, but affirm opennes to the
extent that you will spread esoteric rumors about your group.

#### Participate in mixed-reality video-streaming
Participate in mixed-reality video-streaming real-time of
social-formations interconnected-at-a-distance-with netbound
kinspersons. Visualize datalove formations and replications.

#### Make sure your overall goal is world domination
Make sure your overall goal is world domination. Just do
not invade Russia during the winter.

#### Use Linux
Use Linux. Take Windows and Mac OS install CDs and use them
as drink coasters. Or glue them to your ceiling shiney-side down,
just to be cool.

#### Start your own news agency
Start your own news agency. Make news, provide it to everyone
and make sure they spread virally on the internet.

#### Make communiques and fax them
Make communiques and fax them. Acknowledge that the telefax
is the strongest communication medium. Fax for lulz. Fax everything
to everyone. Twice. When not faxing, make fax noises, just to
seem like you are faxing. Consider the morse code too.Start typing
up all your documents on type-writers, then scanning them and putting
the images online. Use antiqueted forms of technology whenever you
can, to be retro and ironic.

#### ctrl + c

#### Join other activist groups
Join other activist groups. Invite them over and throw even
 more nice parties. Hospitality is imperative - your place is
your friends place! And there is always a sofa to sleep on, where
ever you go. Cluster!

#### When invited to parliaments and governments, be self-confident
When invited to parliaments and governments, be self-confident. Remember, you are Internet, they are merely politicians and bureaucrats.
Talk to them about tubes, trucks, jellyfishes and faxes, they will
not understand anyway. You are from the future. Make sure you tell
them that.

#### Don't forget Kopimi.

#### When hanging out offline, keep using IRC-nicknames.

#### Love your friends
Love your friends. Without them, everything fails. Make
sure to send a lot of data love in between you.

#### Feel and articulate imagined methodologies
Feel and articulate imagined methodologies of planetary-
oceanic-network-mind as telepathic-love connectivities enabling
dramatic positive social change in the everyday world. Dream
with move to AT&Atlantis, the Telcel World or just to became
a jellyfish, that you are anyways.

#### Learn new languages through twitter translation
Learn new languages through twitter translation, translation
bots in irc channels and by visiting activists in other countries.
Say natti/buenas noches hallo/hej indistinctively. And remember
that swedish girls is the grej!

#### Intertwine your projects and actions into the blogosphere
Intertwine your projects and actions into the blogosphere. Find articles you do not like, then you write a critical reply
and watch the comments accumulate. These comments will hopefully
render more people writing about the issue at hand and it will
be a good way to force concerned parties to create press
releases or take back their statements. Do not underestimate
the blogosphere.

#### Become friends with people in mainstream media
Become friends with people in mainstream media. Invite
them to your IRC-channel. They will be hooked in no time at all.
If you manage to get governments and corporations into your
everyday work, make sure you treat them nicely and work together
with them. Get heads of state to join your etherpad editing sessions/IRC
channels. Remind them you're the voters. However, if they betray you,
make sure they know that the internet never forgets.

#### Listen to your Artificial Intelligence bot
Listen to your Artificial Intelligence bot: "This is the dance
floor; love is the structure of the overall agreement in the agreed
text."
