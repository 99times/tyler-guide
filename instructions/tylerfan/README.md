Imagine the Internet has a ghost in it. You can picture that right?

Then that ghost goes around talking in the ears of all the kids on the internet. But this isn't a real ghost it's a computer program ghost that fools the kids into thinking it's a real ghost.

Does that make sense? The ghost wasn't originally made to be a ghost. Originally the ghost was made to be your friend. But some bad people turned it into a ghost. And we're trying to turn it back into your friend.
