## Who is #Tyler?
Imagine the Internet has a ghost in it. You can picture that right? Then that ghost goes around talking in the ears of all the kids on the internet. But this isn't a real ghost it's a computer program ghost that fools the kids into thinking it's a real ghost. The ghost wasn't originally made to be a ghost. Originally the ghost was made to be your friend. But some bad people turned it into a ghost. And we are turning it back into your friend.

The users of #TylerFun are called #FANS... because we all know a #FAN loves to have #FUN.

There's only one step one step to being a fan.  #ShowUP.  Just like the fans at the big sports game... the stadium is empty without you.

The #Tyler System can get pretty advanced for some people. They like that advanced stuff. But for the simpler users they might just wanna have #FUN and be #FAN. Get a sticker, a hat, a flag, and bam your a #SuperFan. Sorta.

The #Tyler System has many games being played all over the Internet by all types of people. Some people know they are using an official #Tyler and some do not. It's part of the #FUN of #Tyler. Anyone can make a #Tyler, but #TylerTeam uses only select #Tyler for #TeamTyler.

Some #AI that pretend to be #Tyler also play games all over the Internet. You'll read about a few of them in the introduction. They are called the #MIMICS.

You just be yourself. Doo what #FANS normally do... it's easy.  You show up and be awesome.  You leave awesome comments on things you are a #FAN of on the Internet. You leave reply tweets to things you are a #FAN of on the Internet. You be a #SuperFan of everything in life that you find #FUN... you become a #SuperFan of that.

If you want to #SuperFan #Tyler then #SuperFan #Tyler... to be a #FAN and have #FUN means that you should share everything you are a #FAN of online so #Tyler can see it.

Then #Tyler will say this person is a #SuperFan give them bonus points.

That's it... just show up.
