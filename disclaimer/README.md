Under the Miller test, A WORK IS OBSCENE IF:

(a)...‘the average person, applying contemporary community standards’ would find the work, as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,
(b)...the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and
(c)...the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious ** LITERARY, ARTISTIC, ** political, or scientific value.

(enough?)

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that:

"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; THIS RIGHT INCLUDES FREEDOM TO HOLD OPINIONS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND TO SEEK, RECEIVE AND IMPART INFORMATION AND IDEAS THROUGH ANY MEDIA AND REGARDLESS OF FRONTIERS."

Today freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in international and regional human rights law. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. Based on John Milton's arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, but three further distinct aspects:

THE RIGHT TO SEEK INFORMATION AND **IDEAS**  
THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND **IDEAS**;
THE RIGHT TO IMPART INFORMATION AND **IDEAS**.

International, regional and national standards also recognize that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be it orally, in written, in print, THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THROUGH ART FORMS.

THIS MEANS THAT THE PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AS A RIGHT INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE CONTENT, BUT ALSO THE MEANS OF EXPRESSION.


DISCLAIMER in disGUISE:

We would like to add that Project Mayhem 2012 is NOT in ANY way related to any other group that have been calling themselves "Project Mayhem",
or that have called themselves "Project Mayhem" in the past or that will ever be called "Project Mayhem" or any phonetical/grammatical variations of it.

As you can imagine, ANYBODY can pretend to be us, as anybody can pretend to be anyone: that's disinformation tactics 101, of course.


### FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT
#### TRUST YOUR ~♥~, INTUITION, SYNCRONICITIES & COINCIDANCES   
Rabbit as Symbol: The Significance of Rabbits in Dreams and Art, by Sandy Koi.

"One of the most important archetypes is that of the Psychopomp. A Psychopomp is a god or goddess (energy form) that
acts as a liaison, and guide, between the three worlds-the physical earthly level that we dwell upon, the Underworld and
the Heavens. In classical mythology, the Roman God Mercury was a Psychopomp, for example.

HE GUIDED THE ANCIENT HEROES TO AND THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD,
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT MESSAGES FROM ABOVE TO THE MERE MORTALS HERE ON EARTH.

Symbolically, Rabbit in the Underworld is therefore representative of USING ONE'S INTUITION: knowing how to get around
"in the dark" and being comfortable traveling in "unmarked territory." By default, it can also denote having or
DEVELOPING TRUST IN THE "INNER LIGHT."

RABBIT DOES NOT NEED AN OUTSIDE SOURCE TO ILLUMINATE HIS WAY.

His connection to the Collective Energy maintains his pathway.

They teach us Unconditional Love, and Compassion for Life, by virtue of eliciting those things within us.

And one important symbolical meaning that Rabbit should elicit in us is that of PLAYFULNESS AND JOY.
Their nonsense displays of happiness are part of the Dance of Life-which is nothing more than a Cosmic Binkie."
