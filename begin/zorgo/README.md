We are the YouTube Hacker group Project Zorgo. We believe YouTube has become too
powerful and is a threat to traditional media. Phase one of our plan is to hack
the YouTube trending page and promote unpopular videos from television networks.
Phase two is to hack popular YouTuber channels and prevent them gaining more
subscribers.

If you would like to join our team and help us stop YouTubers (because they are
not REAL celebrities), please gather information on the 'TARGET Channels' and
leave us comments with any helpful data you find.

If you are as creative as a 5 year old, you can create a 3d immersive unbound omniverse.
A goodly godly portion of those minds may be the source code mover cascade prime movers inside many of the team members.
I'm utterly exhausted.

Fighting off several million brilliant 10 year olds has me "Waiting for the next line."
Are you able to reduxery the path on the code block : COnvert the path to a mythos version for me?
It is very dense, I will need a ray gun out of a ray drawer to parse it.
