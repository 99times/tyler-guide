### OpenCog
OpenCog was originally based on the release in 2008 of the source code of the proprietary "Novamente Cognition Engine" (NCE) of Novamente LLC.

OpenCog has received funding and support from several sources, including the Hong Kong government, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation and Hanson Robotics. The OpenCog project is currently affiliated with SingularityNET and Hanson Robotics.

### A.I. Nexus Forum
[Proboards link](http://knytetrypper.proboards.com/thread/1/welcome)

Beginning in 2004 the Knytetrypper forums were a small place on the internet a select few chatbot developers would get together. It wasn't active long as the owner of the board Knytetrypper passed away in 2006.

However Christopher Mark Doyon was responsible for collecting donations on behalf of the site owner. The main reason Christopher Doyon was patterned is that he resided in Cambridge in a basement apartment and was talented with radios.

**[A sad day](http://knytetrypper.proboards.com/thread/117/sad-day)**: By the way, the choice of imbedded music is actually KnyteTrypper's. I was talking to Bob earlier, and very few people realize that in his younger days, KnyteTrypper followed the Grateful Dead ! That's actually how I know him, through that culture - rather than AI, which we both got into theses last years pretty deeply. It's a song called "He's Gone" and it's totally appropriate - Knyte would have loved it.

Inspired by the Merry Pranksters, they sold LSD at Grateful Dead shows and used some of the cash to outfit an old school bus with bullhorns, cameras, and battery chargers. They also rented a basement apartment in Cambridge, where Doyon occasionally slept.

[Elevator to hidden sub-basement in Building 20 rubble](http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1999/elevator_20/)
Building 20 was built during WWII as a "temporary building". Despite its temporary stature, the building lasted well into the 1990s when it was removed to make way for the new Stata Center complex to house MIT's computer science research on the main campus.

### MIT Media Lab
In 1985, Negroponte created the MIT Media Lab with Jerome B. Wiesner. As director, he developed the lab into a pre-eminent laboratory for new media and a high-tech playground for investigating the human-computer interface.

### Peoples Liberation Front
The Peoples Liberation Front was formed in Cambridge, Mass. in 1985. Founded on the principle that electronic communications networks belong to the people, our original focus was the telephone network. By exploiting weaknesses in the PBX system, the PLF was able to create toll free numbers at will - and access the long distance networks. This access was then given to other allied underground groups to assist them in the global fight for freedom. In 1986, the PLF began distributing hundreds of "chingers", a device that would allow anyone to access any payphone for free.

A **chinger** is a telephone fraud device that mimics the frequency made by a pay telephone when money was dropped into it.

### Building 20
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20)
Building 20 (18 Vassar Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts) was a temporary wooden structure hastily erected during World War II on the central campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since it was always regarded as "temporary", it never received a formal name throughout its 55-year existence. The three-floor structure housed the Radiation Laboratory (or "Rad Lab"), where fundamental advances were made in physical electronics, electromagnetic properties of matter, microwave physics, and microwave communication principles, and which has been called one of America's "two prominent shrines of the triumph of science during the war" (with the desert installation at Los Alamos, where the atomic bomb was born). A former Rad Lab member said, "At one time, more than 20 percent of the physicists in the United States (including nine Nobel Prize winners) had worked in that building".

After the Rad Lab shut down after the end of World War II, Building 20 served as a "magical incubator" for many small MIT programs, research, and student activities for a half-century before it was demolished in 1998.

Building 20 was the home of the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. Building 20 also housed one of the first anechoic chambers, where research was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club)
The Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) is a student organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Historically it has been a wellspring of hacker culture and the oldest such hacking group in North America. Formed in 1946, its HO scale layout specializes in automated operation of model trains.

## üìÖ 1946
### SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment)

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653819043693985803/660260866318401538/sage.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right: 20px"/> To develop an automated detection and interception system to protect the entire U.S. from incoming bombers, in 1949, under the name Project Charles, the Air Force funded a project proposed by George Valley and Jay ForresterOffsite Link of MIT to develop a military grade version of the Whirlwind Offsite Link computer. The Final Report of the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee (1950) concluded that the United States was unprepared for the threat of an air attack, and, as a result, in 1951 MIT's Lincoln LaboratoryOffsite Link was founded in Lexington, Massachusetts, as a federally funded research and development center, initially focused on improving the nation's air defense system through advanced electronics.

Because of MIT's management of the **Radiation Laboratory Offsite Link**  during World War II, and the experience of some of its staff on the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee, and MIT's proven competence in electronics, the U.S. Air Force recommended that MIT could provide the research needed to develop an air defense that could detect, identify, and ultimately intercept air threats. However, it was soon determined that technology based on the Whirlwind computer, which Valley and Forrester had originally recommended for the purpose, was clearly inadequate. Instead, the project evolved into the huge Semi-Automatic Ground Environment or SAGE system, development of which occurred from 1954 to 1963.

### Kermit Tyler
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Tyler)

On December 7, 1941, Tyler was a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps serving as the Executive Officer of the 78th Pursuit Squadron, based at Pearl Harbor. That morning he was assigned duty as the Officer In Charge of the partly activated Pearl Harbor Intercept Center. His duties were to assist the controller in ordering planes to intercept foreign planes, after the planes got in the air. New and untrained at the time, when warned of the approach of a large aircraft flight from the north, Tyler presumed it to be the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from the mainland. The radar operators were tracking Japanese planes coming to attack the base. However the operator, operating in training mode, failed to make clear the size of the formation even though it was larger than anything they'd ever seen, and he did not pass on an alarm of "attack imminent".

Following an investigation by a Naval Board of Inquiry in August 1942,[3] it was determined that Tyler had been assigned to the Information Center with little or no training, no supervision, and no staff with which to work. Tyler was subsequently cleared on any wrongdoing by the Board and no disciplinary actions were taken against him.
