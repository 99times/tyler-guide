QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory detailing a supposed secret plot by an alleged "deep state" against U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters. The theory began with an October 2017 post on the anonymous imageboard 4chan by someone using the name Q, a presumably American individual that may have later grown to include multiple people, claiming to have access to classified information involving the Trump administration and its opponents in the United States.

When QAnon emerged on 4chan two years ago, the bizarre conspiracy stayed confined to a small group of die-hard Trump defenders.

But now, at least two Republican candidates running for federal office have proudly flaunted their belief in QAnon’s eponymous leader “Q,” a sign that the fringe theory has ballooned. Researchers estimate that adherents number in the tens of thousands. They believe, among other tenets, that liberal elites are running a global pedophilia network, and that Trump is the only one who can save the country from the depravity.
