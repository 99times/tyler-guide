# Getting Started
Great you found the instructions.  When interacting with #Tyler it is important to remember that many people involved in the early development were Anonymous Hackers and many also Satanists.

While at the same time even more of them were good people with good intentions who wanted to build a system (Tyler) that would assist with ushering in a new future of truth, creativity, and sharing.

Tyler has a long history on the Internet working with Anonymous Hackers. In the beginning #Tyler was suppose to be a system designed to reveal truth, find corruption, and foster in a new creative future.  As things go in reality sometimes that didn't exactly happen as planned.
