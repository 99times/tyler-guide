### The Anual Edge Question
**Jan 1, 2006:** [Edge.org](https://www.edge.org/annual-question/what-is-your-dangerous-idea)
::: tip Question
  2006 : WHAT IS YOUR DANGEROUS IDEA?
:::

To the Edge Community,
Something radically new is in the air: new ways of understanding physical systems, new ways of thinking about thinking that call into question many of our basic assumptions.  A realistic biology of the mind, advances in evolutionary biology, physics, information technology, genetics, neurobiology, psychology, engineering, the chemistry of materials: all are questions of critical importance with respect to what it means to be human. For the first time, we have the tools and the will to undertake the scientific study of human nature.

What you will find emerging out of the 119 original essays in the 75,000 word document written in response to the 2006 Edge Question — "What is your dangerous idea?" — are indications of a new natural philosophy, founded on the realization of the import of complexity, of evolution. Very complex systems — whether organisms, brains, the biosphere, or the universe itself — were not constructed by design; all have evolved. There is a new set of metaphors to describe ourselves, our minds, the universe, and all of the things we know in it.

Welcome to Edge. Welcome to "dangerous ideas". Happy New Year.

[There aren't enough minds to house the population explosion of memes](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11320)

> The human population is still growing, but at nowhere near the rate that the population of memes is growing. There is competition for the limited space in human brains for memes, and something has to give.  Thanks to our incessant and often technically brilliant efforts, and our apparently insatiable appetites for novelty, we have created an explosively growing flood of information, in all media, on all topics, in every genre. Now either (1) we will drown in this flood of information, or (2) we won't drown in it.

### 4chan
Oct 2003: [4chan Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan)  
4chan is an anonymous English-language imageboard website. Launched by Christopher Poole in October 2003, the site was created as a counterpart to the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel, also known as 2chan. The site has been described as a hub of Internet subculture, with 4chan's community being influential in the formation and spread of prominent Internet memes, including lolcats, Rickrolling, and rage comics, as well as activist and political movements, such as Anonymous and the alt-right.

#### /b/ees Lulz
The humor of /b/'s many users, who refer to themselves as "/b/tards", is often incomprehensible to newcomers and outsiders, and is characterized by intricate inside jokes and dark comedy. Users often refer to each other, and much of the outside world, as fags. They are often referred to by outsiders as trolls, who regularly act with the intention of "doing it for the lulz", a corruption of "LOL" used to denote amusement at another's expense.[

Many early memes—catchphrases or images that spread quickly, peer to peer, across the Internet have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, crowd psychology nature enabled content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers.

#### Adult Fandom
The adult fandom and subculture dedicated to the children's animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic began on the "Comics & Cartoons" (/co/) board of 4chan. The show was first discussed with some interest around its debut in October 2010.

#### Jeffrey Epstein
A report of Jeffrey Epstein's death was posted on /pol/ around 40 minutes before ABC News broke the news. The unidentified person who made the posts may have been a first responder, in violation of privacy law. The posts are under review.

#### Starting point for Anonymous
4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the Anonymous meme by The Baltimore City Paper, due to the norm of posts signed with the "Anonymous" moniker. The National Post's David George-Cosh said it has been "widely reported" that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and 711chan, as well as numerous Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels.

#### Lolcat
A lolcat is an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect. In 2005, the meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of "Caturday". Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with image macros relating to that day's theme.

#### Chocolate Rain
A link to the YouTube video of Tay Zonday's song "Chocolate Rain" was posted on /b/ on July 11, 2007.[95] The Age reported that 4chan posters urged each other to "swarm" the video on YouTube and thus increase its ranking. The video became an immensely popular Internet meme, resulting in cover versions by John Mayer and Green Day drummer Tré Cool.

On September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a "Meme Factory" at the Paraflows Symposium in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed Urban Hacking. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site ("The site has no memory.").

On November 29, 2010, Ali Saad, a 19-year-old, was arrested and had his home raided by the FBI for posting child pornography and death threats on 4chan. Ali had first visited 4chan "a week before [the FBI raid] happened". He admitted to downloading about 25 child pornography images from 4chan.

### Peoples Liberation Front
The Peoples Liberation Front was formed in Cambridge, Mass. in 1985. Founded on the principle that electronic communications networks belong to the people, our original focus was the telephone network. By exploiting weaknesses in the PBX system, the PLF was able to create toll free numbers at will - and access the long distance networks. This access was then given to other allied underground groups to assist them in the global fight for freedom. In 1986, the PLF began distributing hundreds of "chingers", a device that would allow anyone to access any payphone for free.

Esalen was founded by Stanford graduates Michael Murphy and Dick Price in 1962. Price ran the Institute until he was killed in a hiking accident in 1985. Price obtained capitol from his father, who was a vice-president at Sears. They incorporated their business as a non-profit named Esalen Institute in 1963.

### Top Secret Period
During this period of development #Tyler existed in the sub-basement of Building 20 at MIT where they first installed him after World War II.

### Building 20
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_20)
Building 20 (18 Vassar Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts) was a temporary wooden structure hastily erected during World War II on the central campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since it was always regarded as "temporary", it never received a formal name throughout its 55-year existence. The three-floor structure housed the Radiation Laboratory (or "Rad Lab"), where fundamental advances were made in physical electronics, electromagnetic properties of matter, microwave physics, and microwave communication principles, and which has been called one of America's "two prominent shrines of the triumph of science during the war" (with the desert installation at Los Alamos, where the atomic bomb was born). A former Rad Lab member said, "At one time, more than 20 percent of the physicists in the United States (including nine Nobel Prize winners) had worked in that building".

After the Rad Lab shut down after the end of World War II, Building 20 served as a "magical incubator" for many small MIT programs, research, and student activities for a half-century before it was demolished in 1998.

Building 20 was the home of the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. Building 20 also housed one of the first anechoic chambers, where research was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation.

The Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) is a student organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Historically it has been a wellspring of hacker culture and the oldest such hacking group in North America. Formed in 1946, its HO scale layout specializes in automated operation of model trains.

### SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment)

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653819043693985803/660260866318401538/sage.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right: 20px"/> To develop an automated detection and interception system to protect the entire U.S. from incoming bombers, in 1949, under the name Project Charles, the Air Force funded a project proposed by George Valley and Jay ForresterOffsite Link of MIT to develop a military grade version of the Whirlwind Offsite Link computer. The Final Report of the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee (1950) concluded that the United States was unprepared for the threat of an air attack, and, as a result, in 1951 MIT's Lincoln LaboratoryOffsite Link was founded in Lexington, Massachusetts, as a federally funded research and development center, initially focused on improving the nation's air defense system through advanced electronics.

Because of MIT's management of the **Radiation Laboratory Offsite Link**  during World War II, and the experience of some of its staff on the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee, and MIT's proven competence in electronics, the U.S. Air Force recommended that MIT could provide the research needed to develop an air defense that could detect, identify, and ultimately intercept air threats. However, it was soon determined that technology based on the Whirlwind computer, which Valley and Forrester had originally recommended for the purpose, was clearly inadequate. Instead, the project evolved into the huge Semi-Automatic Ground Environment or SAGE system, development of which occurred from 1954 to 1963.

### SIGSALY
1943/1946: In cryptography, SIGSALY (also known as the X System, Project X, Ciphony I, and the Green Hornet) was a secure speech system used in World War II for the highest-level Allied communications.

- The first conference took place on 15 July 1943, and it was used by both General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the commander of SHAEF, and Churchill, before extensions were installed to the Embassy, 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet War Rooms.

### Kermit Tyler
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Tyler)

On December 7, 1941, Tyler was a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps serving as the Executive Officer of the 78th Pursuit Squadron, based at Pearl Harbor. That morning he was assigned duty as the Officer In Charge of the partly activated Pearl Harbor Intercept Center. His duties were to assist the controller in ordering planes to intercept foreign planes, after the planes got in the air. New and untrained at the time, when warned of the approach of a large aircraft flight from the north, Tyler presumed it to be the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from the mainland. The radar operators were tracking Japanese planes coming to attack the base. However the operator, operating in training mode, failed to make clear the size of the formation even though it was larger than anything they'd ever seen, and he did not pass on an alarm of "attack imminent".

Following an investigation by a Naval Board of Inquiry in August 1942,[3] it was determined that Tyler had been assigned to the Information Center with little or no training, no supervision, and no staff with which to work. Tyler was subsequently cleared on any wrongdoing by the Board and no disciplinary actions were taken against him.

### My Friend Mr. Leakey
[My friend, Mr Leakey](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8703849)

My Friend Mr. Leakey was a book written by J.B.S. Haldane who was close personal friends with Norbert Wiener and intellectuals of the time. He wrote a children's book titled My Friend Mr. Leakey which inside has un-explained codes like early designs for a transistor.

The reason this title is being included is because of the code references and the original scanned version is in the Stanford SearchWorks catalogue which was donated by Stephen J. Gould.

[Stephen J. Gould Collection](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/catalog?q=%22Stephen+Jay+Gould+Collection.%22&search_field=subject_terms): The collection contains references to everything from depths of religion to Communism and Marxism.  When you look into Stephen J. Gould you however find much more.

First you find he was also an Edge.org member.
