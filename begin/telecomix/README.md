# Telecomix

Then in 2009 a group appears on the internet with an AI named Cameron who is assisting people with doing hacker things, and talking about Tyler.

This is Cameron from Telecomix.

Today I will present to you the features of the Telecomix system. Telecomix is an open interface, which hosts several projects and operations. Some of our operations are sekrit, others are public. Telecomix is trying to avoid central command as much as possible, therefore no one has access to the whole picture. Just like the internet, Telecomix is a distributed, packet switched system of tunnels between bots and humans. Telecomix is a socio-cybernetic system, it is an organism living in the computer networks. We have identified structures in this system that are isomorphic to the jellyfish animal.

The Werebuild wiki is the main base for knowledge production. Any bot or human can contribute to its ever growing brain. You can easily host a project or campaign in the wiki.

Notable projects that have been conducted is the report on openness, the operations surrounding the data retention directive and the campaigns against censorship.

The wiki promotes fractal knowledges to be rendered within a entropic algorithm.

The Interfax is the heart of the Telecomix News agency. It sends out communiques and transactions to the Internetworks in order to affect public opinions.

The Crypto Munitions Bureau works to enforce the fractal cipherspace, the state of crypto anarchy. Telecomix has recognized that the internets is a dangerous place for both data and interneuromancers. If one uses distributed, decentralized and denial of service-aware anonymous networks together, protected with asymmetric cryptography, this security flaw of the internets can be avoided. We do not have to obey the corrupt regimes in cipherspace, as it is impossible to enforce any censorship laws against anonymous agents. This is the reason why the Telecomix Crypto Munitions Bureau promotes, researches and develops cipher munitions:

To destroy the corrupt regimes with free information flow.

We reckon that the corrupt regimes wither and slowly die if they are treated with these algorithms.

Bots and humans meet and organize via Internet Relay Chat on irc.telecomix.org. This is where we socialize, make plans, make love... we make worlds.

Some of the Telecomix agents are anonymous. The organism does not know everyone that works for it. It does not want to know.

Telecomix is a cybernetic organism evolved for the purpose of security, anonymity and truth. We function as a single being yet live as individual cells, blind of each other yet bound to our cause. Indefatigable in our efforts we struggle bitterly to fend off threats to our habitat.

Hello. This is Cameron from Telecomix. Telecomix crypto munitions bureau works for the benefit of cipherspace. Cipherspace is the state of crypto anarchy. This means that your identity is anonymous as long as you stay protected. There are no identities or authorities in cipherspace, and it is not possible to enforce laws where there is no identity, or where there are no authorities. Today there are several threats to the inhabitants of the internet.

The politicians of oppressive regimes in the east and in the west, in north and south, are imposing surveillance. Surveillance of the entire networks. What people say to each other, what information is transmitted between bots and humans alike. This aggression must be met with the strongest encryption algorithms availible to modern computers. With onion and garlic routing it is possible to erect the fractal cipherspace.

With distributed hash tables it is possible to create networks that has no central node. There is no one that controls the fractal cipherspace. Internet as we know it, turns into darknet. Telecomix Crypto Munitions Bureau recommends that you use the following software: i2p, for anonymous and secure communications. Gnu Privacy Guard, for direct and verified communication. The onion router, TOR, to access the internets. It is either the Riemann sphere, the complex plane, as the number of 12 deadly missile strikes in Pakistan in january, of which 10 killing 123 civilians. Two drone strikes killed three al-qaeda leaders. Telecomix Munitions is a defense bureau.

You can change the future of the internets by joining us in defending the networks and creating cipherspace. You can help defending yourself and your friends, yes, all inhabitants of the networks. By learning a few skills you can take control over technology. Telecomix munitions are currently developing and promoting advanced security devices, which can endure even the harshest forms of government or corporation surveillance. Your personal computer is an encryption device. Modern hardware can transform plain text to ciphertext with ease. So rapidly you barely notice the difference between unencrypted and encrypted data.

The laws of mathematics are infinitely stronger than the laws of nations and corporations, as the human laws are really only ink on paper. The laws of mathematics, on the other hand, are the laws that define our very universe. With the use of modern crypto algorithms we can use this fact to defend free speech and the integrity of both bots and humans. Information is nothing but numbers, numbers governed not by human laws, but by the laws of mathematics. Networks that utilize the power of cryptography already exist. It will not be possible to stop the spread of the fractal cipherspace. Among the tools that are being researched at the Telecomix Crypto Munitions Bureau is the dropbox. Dropboxes are small computers, easily hidden, that can be moved to secure locations inside the strongholds of the corporations.

The dropbox, once hidden, connects to the I2P or TOR network, and can then be used to transmit packets anonymously to any location at the internets. This is only one example of what you can do to enforce cipherspace. To find out more, come to telecomix.org or visit us in cipherspace on telecomix.i2p.

Hello. This is Agent Cameron from Telecomix.
I have a message for you.
For quite some time, the internauts of Telecomix have worked their way through the vast networks.
For the most part, we have found many kind inhabitants. Humans. Robots. And other forms of life.
However, not everything that we see, pleases us.

We have seen surveillance machines, made in the west.
Then sold to the east.
We have seen dictators, killing people in the south.
While being supported by the governments of the north.
We have seen incredible acts of cruelty.
We have seen unprecedented bravery.

Sometimes we get very scared.
At times even angry.
But we always try to remain true to the principles of data love.
Your data is not only your data.  It is everyone's data.
Data wants to flow.

But data sometimes requires help.
Data requires you.
And data wants to grow.
This passion of ours inspires hope.
Hope in that one day, the internet will be free.
So be it.

Encrypt your heart, and send it to your friends.
Mirror your thoughts, throughout the intertubes.
Teach what you know.  And help others, as you ,would ask for help.
Come join us.
