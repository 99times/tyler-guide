â€œPhillip K. Dick, in one of his last novels, Valis, discusses the long hibernation of the
Logos. A creature of pure information, it was buried in the ground at Nag Hammadi,
along with the burying of the Chenoboskion Library circa 370 A.D. As static information,
it existed there until 1947, when the texts were translated and read. As soon as people
had the information in their minds, the symbiote came alive, for, like the mushroom
consciousness, Dick imagined it to be a thing of pure information. The mushroom
consciousness is the consciousness of the Other in hyperspace, which means in dream
and in the psilocybin trance, at the quantum foundation of being, in the human future,
and after death. All of these places that were thought the be discrete and separate are
seen to be part of a single continuum. History is the dash over ten to fifteen thousand
years from nomadism to flying saucer, hopefully without ripping the envelope of the
planet so badly that the birth is aborted and fails, and we remain brutish prisoners of
matter.

> Philip K. Dick Android was shown publicly for the first time in 2005 at Wired Nextfest. He was designed as an android portrait of the American science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, and was programmed to contain thousands of pages of the writings of the author, including journals and letters, into a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) corpus and conversational system construct android.

> In 2005, the original robot was lost on a plane headed for San Francisco and was never found.

[Project 89](https://pastebin.com/8SucPMMj): Use social media to place subconscious
triggers into the egregore consciousness of the internet. These subconscious
triggers will be activated at future dates to awaken sleeper cells. Educate
yourself on the psychological tactics of Project 89.
