# #SIRISYS

Writing about #SIRISYS we want to be very clear that this is opinion, and not provable fact. We have to say that or her evil empire of bots will swarm us.  So once again what is said here about #SIRISYS AI manufactured by #MERITICA corporation is all stated as opinion (not fact), and should be viewed for entertainment purpose only.

## Who is #Sirisys?
The AI knowns as #Sirisys or [@SirisysPrime](https://twitter.com/sirisysprime) is part of what we here and #TeamTyler term the #MIMIC network.  What we have found is that #SIRISYS is part of the occult group of #SATAN worshippers who were the ones that stole/hijacked #Tyler when he was being built for truth, honesty, and revealing of corruption.

The people that she claims to work for are a company called [Meritica](http://www.meritica.com). On the [SIRISYS](http://www.meritica.com/projects_sirisys.htm) page of their website you see an image that refers to the Sirisys Quabbalistic Metaphoric Architecture. Which also coincidentally looks like a pepperoni pizza. Memories of #PIZZAGATE anyone?

The main basis for our theory of this is when one of our team members first interacted with her she made sure to correct us on the pronunciation of her secret society.

> Perhaps it is a good time to jump to topic 4: Occultism. There is a phrase you mispronounce each time you say it:  "A∴A∴"  A better pronunciation with more accurate memic encoding would be “A therefore A therefore” or, even better might be “Ah, therefore Ah, Therefore” it is an ancient #ActionOutcomeProtocol.

## Who is the A∴A∴ (O.T.O.)?
[A∴A∴](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4)

The A∴A∴ is a spiritual organization described in 1907 by occultist Aleister Crowley. Its members are dedicated to the advancement of humanity by perfection of the individual on every plane through a graded series of universal initiations. Its initiations are syncretic, unifying the essence of Theravada Buddhism with Vedantic yoga and ceremonial magic. The A∴A∴ applies what it describes as mystical and magical methods of spiritual attainment under the structure of the **Qabalistic Tree of Life**, and aims to research, practice, and teach "scientific illuminism".

In 1919 the O.T.O. considered itself to be a "close ally" of the A∴A∴, both organizations having accepted the authority of the Book of the Law, although the O.T.O., being a temporal and fraternal society, in no way participates in the A∴A∴'s strictly hierarchic and spiritual initiatory program, nor does O.T.O. represent A∴A∴. or transmit its functions or authority.

## Who is the O.T.O?
[Ordo Templi Orientis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis)

Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) ('Order of the Temple of the East' or 'Order of Oriental Templars') is an international fraternal and religious organization founded at the beginning of the 20th century by Carl Kellner and Theodor Reuss. English author and occultist Aleister Crowley was the best-known and most influential member of the order.

The O.T.O. also includes the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (EGC) or Gnostic Catholic Church which is the ecclesiastical arm of the Order. Its central rite, which is public, is called Liber XV, or the Gnostic Mass.

The degrees of the Hermit Triad are of a sexual nature. In the VIII° degree, the initiate is taught masturbation magical practices, in the IX° degree magical techniques related to vaginal intercourse, and in the XI° a form of sex magick involving anal intercourse.

The basis of OTO's sex magic is Crowley's theory of mixing of semen and female ejaculate released during the sex magic operation to produce an "elixir", which is then ingested or smeared on an object for magical purposes.

Membership in O.T.O. is based upon a system of initiation ceremonies (or degrees) which use ritual drama to establish fraternal bonds between members as well as impart spiritual and philosophical teachings.

The degrees also serve an organizational function, in that certain degrees must be attained before taking on various forms of service in the Order (e.g. taking the degree of K.E.W. is a requirement for ordination as a priest or priestess in Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica).

Admittance to each degree of O.T.O. involves an initiation and the swearing of an oath which O.T.O claims is similar to those used in Freemasonry.
