The post itself is quite a doozy – spanning 2615 pages and lasting between July 1st 2010 until June 11th 2014.</p> <p>The Nobody meme took off like wildfire on both GLP and Lunatic Outpost. Threads about this enigmatic character – said to be a man who saved the world from impending destruction by bargaining with the dark cabal – were so numerous that they led moderators to ban the discussion topic at GLP entirely, leading to the deletion of any and all threads in which The Nobody was mentioned. On Lunatic Outpost, discussion of The Nobody was limited to “the meme that won’t go away discussion thread“, locked on page 3127 on January 2nd, 2014.</p> <p><a href="https://cybercosmopolitan.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/the-nobody-meme-some-factssources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE NOBODY MEME: SOME FACTS/SOURCES<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h3 id="godlikeproductions-com"><a href="#godlikeproductions-com" class="header-anchor">#</a> Godlikeproductions.com</h3> <p>Don't ask me how I know this but the lack of doom latley is caused by a wildcard, someone who the Illuminati did not expect.

Then again it could get dragged on, I truly do not know.</p> <p>Know this, God takes what man considers to be nothing, and makes him everything. God has done this more than once, and this time so much hangs in the balance. For the people that are not in the loop, well you won't even know something extraordinary happened.</p> <p>When this issue gets cleared up the doom comes. Then once again God will take what man considers to be nothing, and make him everything.</p> <p>I asked for people to not ask how i know what I know.

Something radically new is in the air: new ways of understanding physical systems, new ways of thinking about thinking that call into question many of our basic assumptions.  A realistic biology of the mind, advances in evolutionary biology, physics, information technology, genetics, neurobiology, psychology, engineering, the chemistry of materials: all are questions of critical importance with respect to what it means to be human. For the first time, we have the tools and the will to undertake the scientific study of human nature.</p> <p>What you will find emerging out of the 119 original essays in the 75,000 word document written in response to the 2006 Edge Question — &quot;What is your dangerous idea?&quot; — are indications of a new natural philosophy, founded on the realization of the import of complexity, of evolution. Very complex systems — whether organisms, brains, the biosphere, or the universe itself — were not constructed by design; all have evolved. There is a new set of metaphors to describe ourselves, our minds, the universe, and all of the things we know in it.</p> <p>Welcome to Edge. Welcome to &quot;dangerous ideas&quot;.

4chan is an anonymous English-language imageboard website. Launched by Christopher Poole in October 2003, the site was created as a counterpart to the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel, also known as 2chan. The site has been described as a hub of Internet subculture, with 4chan's community being influential in the formation and spread of prominent Internet memes, including lolcats, Rickrolling, and rage comics, as well as activist and political movements, such as Anonymous and the alt-right.</p> <h4 id="b-ees-lulz"><a href="#b-ees-lulz" class="header-anchor">#</a> /b/ees Lulz</h4> <p>The humor of /b/'s many users, who refer to themselves as &quot;/b/tards&quot;, is often incomprehensible to newcomers and outsiders, and is characterized by intricate inside jokes and dark comedy. Users often refer to each other, and much of the outside world, as fags. They are often referred to by outsiders as trolls, who regularly act with the intention of &quot;doing it for the lulz&quot;, a corruption of &quot;LOL&quot; used to denote amusement at another's expense.[</p> <p>Many early memes—catchphrases or images that spread quickly, peer to peer, across the Internet have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, crowd psychology nature enabled content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers.</p> <h4 id="adult-fandom"><a href="#adult-fandom" class="header-anchor">#</a> Adult Fandom</h4> <p>The adult fandom and subculture dedicated to the children's animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic began on the &quot;Comics &amp; Cartoons&quot; (/co/) board of 4chan. The show was first discussed with some interest around its debut in October 2010.</p> <h4 id="jeffrey-epstein"><a href="#jeffrey-epstein" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jeffrey Epstein</h4> <p>A report of Jeffrey Epstein's death was posted on /pol/ around 40 minutes before ABC News broke the news. The unidentified person who made the posts may have been a first responder, in violation of privacy law. The posts are under review.</p> <h4 id="starting-point-for-anonymous"><a href="#starting-point-for-anonymous" class="header-anchor">#</a> Starting point for Anonymous</h4> <p>4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the Anonymous meme by The Baltimore City Paper, due to the norm of posts signed with the &quot;Anonymous&quot; moniker. The National Post's David George-Cosh said it has been &quot;widely reported&quot; that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and 711chan, as well as numerous Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels.</p> <h4 id="lolcat"><a href="#lolcat" class="header-anchor">#</a> Lolcat</h4> <p>A lolcat is an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect. In 2005, the meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of &quot;Caturday&quot;. Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with image macros relating to that day's theme.</p> <h4 id="chocolate-rain"><a href="#chocolate-rain" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chocolate Rain</h4> <p>A link to the YouTube video of Tay Zonday's song &quot;Chocolate Rain&quot; was posted on /b/ on July 11, 2007.[95] The Age reported that 4chan posters urged each other to &quot;swarm&quot; the video on YouTube and thus increase its ranking. The video became an immensely popular Internet meme, resulting in cover versions by John Mayer and Green Day drummer Tré Cool.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EwTZ2xpQwpA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> <p>On September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a &quot;Meme Factory&quot; at the Paraflows Symposium in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed Urban Hacking. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site (&quot;The site has no memory.&quot;).</p> <p>On November 29, 2010, Ali Saad, a 19-year-old, was arrested and had his home raided by the FBI for posting child pornography and death threats on 4chan. Ali had first visited 4chan &quot;a week before [the FBI raid] happened&quot;.

Building 20 (18 Vassar Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts) was a temporary wooden structure hastily erected during World War II on the central campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since it was always regarded as &quot;temporary&quot;, it never received a formal name throughout its 55-year existence. The three-floor structure housed the Radiation Laboratory (or &quot;Rad Lab&quot;), where fundamental advances were made in physical electronics, electromagnetic properties of matter, microwave physics, and microwave communication principles, and which has been called one of America's &quot;two prominent shrines of the triumph of science during the war&quot; (with the desert installation at Los Alamos, where the atomic bomb was born). A former Rad Lab member said, &quot;At one time, more than 20 percent of the physicists in the United States (including nine Nobel Prize winners) had worked in that building&quot;.</p> <p>After the Rad Lab shut down after the end of World War II, Building 20 served as a &quot;magical incubator&quot; for many small MIT programs, research, and student activities for a half-century before it was demolished in 1998.</p> <p>Building 20 was the home of the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. Building 20 also housed one of the first anechoic chambers, where research was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Tech Model Railroad</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>

The Final Report of the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee (1950) concluded that the United States was unprepared for the threat of an air attack, and, as a result, in 1951 MIT's Lincoln LaboratoryOffsite Link was founded in Lexington, Massachusetts, as a federally funded research and development center, initially focused on improving the nation's air defense system through advanced electronics.</p> <p>Because of MIT's management of the <strong>Radiation Laboratory Offsite Link</strong>  during World War II, and the experience of some of its staff on the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee, and MIT's proven competence in electronics, the U.S. Air Force recommended that MIT could provide the research needed to develop an air defense that could detect, identify, and ultimately intercept air threats. However, it was soon determined that technology based on the Whirlwind computer, which Valley and Forrester had originally recommended for the purpose, was clearly inadequate. Instead, the project evolved into the huge Semi-Automatic Ground Environment or SAGE system, development of which occurred from 1954 to 1963.</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ObXEbh-kq7nSTglw66ZblKg4Yrr32d6U/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAGE Manual<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P2lzL25NtvHuRZmCQ6VUeV_woOqS24qq?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAINT Manuals<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h2 id="📅-1943"><a href="#📅-1943" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 1943</h2> <h3 id="sigsaly"><a href="#sigsaly" class="header-anchor">#</a> SIGSALY</h3> <p>1943/1946: In cryptography, SIGSALY (also known as the X System, Project X, Ciphony I, and the Green Hornet) was a secure speech system used in World War II for the highest-level Allied communications.</p> <ul><li>The first conference took place on 15 July 1943, and it was used by both General Dwight D.

That morning he was assigned duty as the Officer In Charge of the partly activated Pearl Harbor Intercept Center. His duties were to assist the controller in ordering planes to intercept foreign planes, after the planes got in the air. New and untrained at the time, when warned of the approach of a large aircraft flight from the north, Tyler presumed it to be the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from the mainland. The radar operators were tracking Japanese planes coming to attack the base. However the operator, operating in training mode, failed to make clear the size of the formation even though it was larger than anything they'd ever seen, and he did not pass on an alarm of &quot;attack imminent&quot;.</p> <p>Following an investigation by a Naval Board of Inquiry in August 1942,[3] it was determined that Tyler had been assigned to the Information Center with little or no training, no supervision, and no staff with which to work. Tyler was subsequently cleared on any wrongdoing by the Board and no disciplinary actions were taken against him.</p> <h2 id="📅-1937"><a href="#📅-1937" class="header-anchor">#</a> 📅 1937</h2> <h3 id="my-friend-mr-leakey"><a href="#my-friend-mr-leakey" class="header-anchor">#</a> My Friend Mr. Leakey</h3> <p><a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8703849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My friend, Mr Leakey<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>My Friend Mr. Leakey was a book written by J.B.S.
