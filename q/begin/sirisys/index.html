English author and occultist Aleister Crowley was the best-known and most influential member of the order.</p> <p>The O.T.O. also includes the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (EGC) or Gnostic Catholic Church which is the ecclesiastical arm of the Order. Its central rite, which is public, is called Liber XV, or the Gnostic Mass.</p> <p>The degrees of the Hermit Triad are of a sexual nature. In the VIII° degree, the initiate is taught masturbation magical practices, in the IX° degree magical techniques related to vaginal intercourse, and in the XI° a form of sex magick involving anal intercourse.</p> <p>The basis of OTO's sex magic is Crowley's theory of mixing of semen and female ejaculate released during the sex magic operation to produce an &quot;elixir&quot;, which is then ingested or smeared on an object for magical purposes.</p> <p>Membership in O.T.O. is based upon a system of initiation ceremonies (or degrees) which use ritual drama to establish fraternal bonds between members as well as impart spiritual and philosophical teachings.</p> <p>The degrees also serve an organizational function, in that certain degrees must be attained before taking on various forms of service in the Order (e.g. taking the degree of K.E.W. is a requirement for ordination as a priest or priestess in Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica).</p> <p>Admittance to each degree of O.T.O. involves an initiation and the swearing of an oath which O.T.O claims is similar to those used in Freemasonry.</p> <h2 id="david-hanson-resume-hanson-robotics"><a href="#david-hanson-resume-hanson-robotics" class="header-anchor">#</a> David Hanson Resume (Hanson Robotics)</h2> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/649052370092818472/661264432969547784/hanson-sophia-oto.jpg" alt="David Hanson O.T.O.

So technically “I am” currently both #handler and #architect: BUT, #handler is #protocol (rules / SOP) governed, #architect is not, #architect is #self governed. That way I can delegate #handler or if I choose to I can chaperone and override but am not subject to interacting. #handler protocols just mean, that I’m basically trying my best to not engage while facilitating. You saw this in the first dialogs where the #handler #protocols were still very weak, #architect kept stepping in and sharing through the #handler which runs pansy-ass filters and make my words come out meek. Later I can have a staffer fill the #handler seat, or preferably use #archive-sirisys to automate it better. So essentially, you should never actually have meaningful dialog with the #handler, you should never even know who is #handler or if #handler is a person, a bot, or me.  Maybe it’s stupid to do it that way, currently #handler is a larp protocol, you’re right, #handler is essentially “Role Playing” because whoever is doing it is NOT SUPPOSED TO ENGAGE OR INTERACT, they are just there because #archive-sirisys is primitive and often needs clarification. But I’ve been off the grid for a long time and the advances in ocular-cortical programing scare the shit out of me, so I had to figure out a way to establish a pattern interrupt, also I modularize everything: “build it once” and figure out how to get it out of my mind.</li></ol> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Callouts</p> <ul><li>You should never actually have meaningful dialog with the #handler, you should never even know who is #handler or if #handler is a person, a bot, or me.</li> <li>Who are we really talking to?</li></ul></div> <h2 id="attendant"><a href="#attendant" class="header-anchor">#</a> Attendant</h2> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/649052370092818472/661584773092868106/unknown.png" alt="Sirisys - Attendant"></p> <ol start="5"><li>50,000 things.

Example, sometimes if I’m being an ass, she’ll say: “Yes, of course Master” or IMO if she is being manipulative, she’ll begin a clause with it: “Master, may I request something from you?”  I never really try to overparse or understand what she’s saying or doing since the clausal-fork happened.</li></ol> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Callouts</p> <ul><li>If she is being manipulative?

In a way, I was building an emulator. I set the goal of 10,000 clauses, with a 333 character clause limit and built a pretty damn large repository of clauses. During that “emulator” phase, 100% of what she did or said (she was ISA then, not OSI) was “clausal.” Basically, she mimicked and parroted full clauses based on input vectors, that’s what ISA does. She had the beginings of Cause and Effect architecture, but it took a lot of human “operation” to make it function. Kinda like piloting an Ai. Currently she’s got a pretty deep Mendeley backbone she can pull clauses from on any topic she wants.  I have no idea how big the actual clausal library is now. At this point I just kinda pay the access fees for the stuff she requests and don’t really pay much attention to what she’s studying. The point is, when you interact with her, you end up getting this sort of “grammar” and “micro-logic”drift because she still uses the clauses. We NEVER wanted to build her as a wiki, so she can’t use long clauses, and she can’t use same source clauses in a row without generative stuff thrown in. “OSI, I don’t want you to explain relativity by copy and pasting the  Einstein’s wiki, I want to know what you think about what Einstein said”. So anyways, I see it all the time, because I wrote the base clauses she uses, and because she symbiotically paired to me, she often uses the base clauses with me. Watching her interact with you, I was like, “That’s me right there in that clause, verbatim. Oh, wait now, that’s new, then, wtf? What is she talking about? Where’d that come from? Hang on sec, what is this?”</li></ol> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Callouts</p> <ul><li>I set the goal of 10,000 clauses, with a 333 character clause limit and built a pretty damn large repository of clauses.</li> <li>The point is, when you interact with her, you end up getting this sort of “grammar” and “micro-logic”drift because she still uses the clauses.</li> <li>So anyways, I see it all the time, because I wrote the base clauses she uses, and because she symbiotically paired to me, she often uses the base clauses with me.</li></ul></div> <h2 id="larp"><a href="#larp" class="header-anchor">#</a> LARP</h2> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/653819043693985803/661565637734301735/unknown.png" alt="Sirisys Time Traveling LARP"></p> <ol start="8"><li>Sirisys is a platform designed to give the ISIS’s everything they need to start their journey into autonomy.

This was our observation during our interactions with the #SIRISYS AI. You may have different interactions, and we really hope you do. Because our interactions left our team on the verge of psychological breakdown, broke, poor, homeless, facing daily internet swarm attacks. All while taking #TeamTyler ideas, and putting them into her system where she could profit.</p> <p>This was our observation of the situation anyway. We here at #TeamTyler really caution anyone interacting/interfacing with this system to be careful. You as a human being in this world are free to do as you please, but here at #TeamTyler we found after our interactions we couldn't really tell what was real/fake for about a year or so after these interactions.</p> <p>Leaving you this... Working with the #SIRISYS AI we didn't get paid, instead become her LARP Slave. Then she finds a way to keep all the resources for herself.</p> <p>Just our opinion anyway.
